## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### Notes

12th challenge from Frontend Mentor. I couln'd find a clean way to have the social button hover in blue. I tried use filter css and fill and 
event change the svg file to put in blue. ^^" Also if someone has an idea about how to avoid my layout "jumping" when the error message appears I'm in.
